# uschedulify
Hello,

this is the final group project that I was part of for CSCI 201. It is a web application called USChedulify, and it would automatically create all the possible schedules given all the courses a user searchs up for USC's Fall 2020 semester.

We used a variety of tools and software that we learned in class and out of class. We used HTML and CSS for our front end, Java and MySQL for our backend, and Heroku and Maven for our website deployment.

We also used multiple Computer Science concepts to create a more sophisticated and efficient program. Some concepts we used were:
- Inheritance
- Classes
- Multithreading/Parallel Programming
- Backtracking

My main role in this project was creating the WebScraper. USC has a website that displays all its courses called USC Schedule of Classes. I saw that if we search for a specific class, it shows that class' information, such as its possible sections, times, and professors, all in a single html table. So I used JSoup in order to scrape all the data and put it in a "course" object. 

Feel free to check it out! (while it's still up)
